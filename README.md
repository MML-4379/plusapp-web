# MML+ Web App

If you would like to run this project locally, you will need to contact us for a package file, as the one bundled has private links to the source code. You will also need to fill in your Firebase info in src/firebase.js.
Some parts of the platform are open source, others are closed source. The API is an example. During build and deploying, the API is used on a virtual client to verify the code. This new system helps catch errors before users can complain about them.
